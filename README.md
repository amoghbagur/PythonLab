# List of programs
# python-basics
1. (Dictionaries_for_if.py) Illustration of dictionary data type, for and if statements.
2. (registerdictionary.py) Create a dictionary 'Register' that holds the names and details of students in a class. Print the roll numbers of the students.
3. (tuples_lists.py) Create a list and perform the following operations on it. a.)find its length b.)add this list into another list c.)use the slice operation to print every second element in the list d.)replace the second element in the list e.)concatenate with another list f.)clone this list g.)split the list evenly. Create a tuple and print the second element in it. Convert this tuple to a list

4. (Atomic.py & elementsdictionary.py) (i)Create a dictionary that contains the atomic element symbol and its name. (ii)Add a unique & duplicate element into this dictionary by interacting with the user. Observe the output and justify it. (iii)Display the number of atomic elements in this dictionary (iv)Ask user to enter an element to search in the dictionary. Display appropriate results.
Rewrite this program so that these operations are inside a function called ‘AtomicDictionary’. Create another python file called “Atomic.py” and execute this function in it.
5. (agecovert.py) The function AgeConvert(num) needs to calculate the age of a person, given the birth date.
6. (changestring.py) The function ChangeString(str) needs to modify the string passed using the following rules:
●Replace every letter in thestring with the letter that follows it in alphabetical order (ie.Z becomes a,l becomes m).
● Take every vowel in this new string (a, e, i, o, u) and Capitalize it.
● Return this modified string. E.g: Input: "hello3" Output: Ifmmp3
7. (classes_objects.py) Illustration of classes and objects in python
8. (hourminute.py) The function HourMinute(num) must return the number of hours and minutes the parameter converts to. Separate the number of hours and minutes with a colon E.g. Input: 126 Output: 2:6 E.g. Input: 45 Output: 0:45
9. (lettersurround.py) The function ​LetterSurround(str) needs to find out if the string passed is an acceptable sequence by either returningtrue or false. The string parameter will be composed of + and = symbols with several characters between them. For the string to be true each letter must be surrounded by + symbol. Test Cases: The string will not be empty and will have at least one letter. E.g: Input: "+d+=3=+s+" Output: true E.g. Input: "f++d+" Output: false
10. (oddrange.py) The function OddRange(num1, num2) takes two integers and needs to return an array of the odd numbers between the given integers.
11. (studentclass.py) (i)Create a Python class called ‘Student’ having ‘name’, ‘age’ as attribute along with a list having the marks obtained for three subjects. (ii)Create a constructor to initialize two objects of this class. (iii)Create a member function called ‘display’ printing the details of a specific object (iv)Ask user to enter the values for an object through an ‘accept’ member function. (v)Display these details.

12. (agecovert.html) The function AgeConvert(num) needs to calculate the age of a person, given the birth date.
13. (calculator.html) Create a simple webpage to add and multiply two numbers.
14.(changestring.html) The function ChangeString(str) needs to modify the string passed using the following rules:
●Replace every letter in thestring with the letter that follows it in alphabetical order (ie.Z becomes a,l becomes m).
● Take every vowel in this new string (a, e, i, o, u) and Capitalize it.
● Return this modified string. E.g: Input: "hello3" Output: Ifmmp3
15. (hourminute.html) The function HourMinute(num) must return the number of hours and minutes the parameter converts to. Separate the number of hours and minutes with a colon E.g. Input: 126 Output: 2:6 E.g. Input: 45 Output: 0:45
16.(lettersurround.html) The function ​LetterSurround(str) needs to find out if the string passed is an acceptable sequence by either returningtrue or false. The string parameter will be composed of + and = symbols with several characters between them. For the string to be true each letter must be surrounded by + symbol. Test Cases: The string will not be empty and will have at least one letter. E.g: Input: "+d+=3=+s+" Output: true E.g. Input: "f++d+" Output: false
17. (oddrange.html) The function OddRange(num1, num2) takes two integers and needs to return an array of the odd numbers between the given integers.
18. (divisible.html) Create a HTML form to accept a number. Include button to check whether the input is divisible by 3 or 7. Display the result. Ensure the data entered in the text box is a number only. Use Javascript for this client side scripting. Display appropriate error texts.
19. (longestword.html & longestword.js) Create a HTML form which contains one text area. Enter a sentence. Find the length of the longest word of that sentence using javascript. Also show the execution of this code with the javascript code as a “.js” file outside the HTML
20. (multiplybuttons.html) Create a HTML form to accept a number. Include two buttons which when clicked a)Button#1 displays value got when the number multiplied by 2. b)Button#2 displays value got when the number is multiplied by itself. Display the result. Ensure the data entered in the text box is a number only. Use Javascript for this client side scripting. Display appropriate error texts.
